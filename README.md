## What is semantic-release?

> semantic-release automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package. This removes the immediate connection between human emotions and version numbers, strictly following the Semantic Versioning specification.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a code execution platform for doing CI/CD. It's similar to services like Travis CI or Circle CI, but it's built right into GitHub.

## Steps to set up Semantic Release on your GitHub repo

- [ ] Only allow squash merging of pull requests
- [ ] Install https://github.com/apps/semantic-pull-requests
- [ ] Create npm token using `npm token create` or https://www.npmjs.com/settings
- [ ] Add token to repo secrets as `NPM_TOKEN`
- [ ] Add release workflow file to `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- [ ] Set `version` to `0.0.0-development` in package.json
- [ ] `npm i -D semantic-release`
- [ ] Use semantic commit messages
- [ ] Create a pull request

## Example Workflow

```yml
name: Release npm package

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: "12.x"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build --if-present
      - run: npm test
      - run: npx semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```
